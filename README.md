# EmployeeManagementSystemApp
My First Attempt at creating a WInUI Application.
Am Open to all suggesstions.

Current Targets:
1) Implementing Navigation From DI
2) Finding out how to pass down db context to the viewmodels (I understand this would be fixed when The Navigation is implemented).
3) Fixing the multiple Item Selecting control in Creation
